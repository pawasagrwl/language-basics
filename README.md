# Language-Basic: Coding Interview Reference

This repository serves as a reference guide for common coding operations in multiple programming languages. The aim is to provide easy to understand and ready to use code snippets that are often forgotten but frequently used in coding interviews.

Each directory in this repository represents a different language and contains a `README.md` file detailing the basics of the language, and a `basics` file with practical code examples.

The following languages are included:

- [C++](./C++/README.md)
- [Golang](./Golang/README.md)
- [Java](./Java/README.md)
- [JavaScript](./JavaScript/README.md)
- [Python](./Python/README.md)
- [Rust](./Rust/README.md)

Each language-specific README covers the following topics:

1. Reading from and writing to files.
2. Reading input from the console.
3. Splitting strings.
4. Understanding the string length.
5. Declaring and using 2D arrays/lists/vectors.
6. Handling null-terminated strings (where applicable).

Feel free to contribute and add more languages or more basic operations that are frequently used in coding interviews.
