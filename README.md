# Language Basics: Coding Interview Reference

This repository serves as a reference guide for common coding operations in multiple programming languages. The aim is to provide easy to understand and ready-to-use code snippets that are often overlooked but frequently used in coding interviews.

Each directory in this repository represents a different language and contains a `README.md` file detailing the basics of that language, along with a `basics` file with practical code examples.

The following languages are included:

- [C++](./c++)
- [Golang](./golang)
- [Java](./java)
- [JavaScript](./js)
- [Python](./python)
- [Rust](./rust)

Each language-specific README covers the following topics:

1. File I/O: Reading From and Writing To Files
2. User Input: Reading Input from the Console
3. String Manipulation: Splitting Strings
4. String Properties: Understanding String Length
5. Data Structures: Declaration and Use of 2D Arrays
6. String Handling: Working with Null-Terminated Strings (where applicable)
7. Data Structures: Utilization of Hashmaps (where applicable)
8. Data Inspection: Finding the Length of an Array or String
9. Data Modification: Adding and Removing Elements from an Array/String

Feel free to contribute and add more languages or more basic operations that are frequently used in coding interviews.
