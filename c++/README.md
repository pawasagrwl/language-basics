# C++ Basic Coding Interview Reference

This repository is a reference guide for common operations in C++, which are often forgotten but frequently used in coding interviews.

Here, you will find code snippets for:

1. Reading from and writing to files.
2. Reading input from the console.
3. Splitting strings.
4. Understanding the string length (Hint: it's not a function).
5. Declaring and using 2D arrays.
6. Handling null-terminated strings.

Refer to the file `basics.cpp` for practical code examples.
