# Golang Basic Coding Interview Reference

This repository is a reference guide for common operations in Golang, which are often forgotten but frequently used in coding interviews.

Here, you will find code snippets for:

1. Reading from and writing to files.
2. Reading input from the console.
3. Splitting strings.
5. Declaring and using 2D slices.
6. Golang handles null-terminated strings implicitly.

Refer to the file `basics.go` for practical code examples.
