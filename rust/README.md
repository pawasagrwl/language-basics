# Rust Basic Coding Interview Reference

This repository is a reference guide for common operations in Rust, which are often forgotten but frequently used in coding interviews.

Here, you will find code snippets for:

1. Reading from and writing to files.
2. Reading input from the console.
3. Splitting strings.
4. Understanding the string length (Hint: it's a method).
5. Declaring and using 2D vectors.
6. Rust handles null-terminated strings implicitly.

Refer to the file `basics.rs` for practical code examples.
